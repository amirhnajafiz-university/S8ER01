Building kernels with bare metal Rustlang.

## Install

### ```nasm```

First you need to have ```nasm``` installed on your machine.
nasm is a free cross-platform x86 assembler which supports
all the common x86 operating systems â€“ Linux, MacOS X and Windows.

When you installed ```nasm``` you can create executable files
from ```.asm``` files, which are assembly files.

### ```hexdump``` and ```ndisasm```

Now with these two commands, you can view and disassemble your
```.asm``` codes in order to see the CPU opcodes.
