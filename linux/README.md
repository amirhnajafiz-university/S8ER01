In this session, we are going to learn Linux operating system. Everything from linux basics 
to linux architecture.

## Why linux?

- Large community
- Big amount of systems are running on linux
- Useful tools

## Kernel

The core of linux. The underlying layer of linux. 
The Linux kernel manages OS resources, making sure there is enough memory 
available for applications to run, optimizing processor usage, and avoiding 
system deadlocks caused by competing application demands.

## Shell

The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. 
It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands.

## Linux on Virtual Machine

Running linux on a VM, but linux does not know that it is running on VM.
For running linux on VM, you need to download a linux distribution image (ubuntu or manjaro or ...).
After that you need to download a virtualization software like VirtualBox. 
Then you can run your image on VMM.
